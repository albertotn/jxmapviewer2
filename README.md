This project is based on the JXMapViewer component of SwingX-WS.

The project was hosted at SwingLabs.org, but has been discontinued. We extracted the JXMapViewer part from the latest SwingX-WS version available and continue developing it.

The [JXMapViewer Tutorial by Joshua Marinacci](http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2007/10/30/building-maps-into-swing-app-with-jxmapviewer.html) gives a good overview over the functionality of the component.
